        </h1>
          <p><strong>Hila-Craft Interiors</strong> is a full-service residential interior design and build firm, founded by Arianne Njambi in 2006. Through her years of experience, Njambi has developed a unique style of mixing old with new and giving each project a timeless feel. Seamlessly juxtaposing limestone, marble, earthy woods, textured fabrics and organic colors with materials such as metal and glass is what gives Njambi's work a striking and harmonious feel.</p>

<p>Hila-Craft Interiors' philosophy is to create inviting and elegant interiors-- straying from trends that will only disappoint in years to come. Their design approach is to Architecturally space plan every square inch of a room to work both aesthetically and functionally. Each project is tailored specifically to each client, as we pay special attention to every detail that goes into project. Known for our incredible Kitchens and Bathroom renovations, challenges such as small spaces and children's rooms are welcome and embraced by us, as we creatively transform some of the smallest most unusable spaces to multi-functional rooms. Hila-Craft Interiors is committed to using sustainable materials, wherever possible.
